# Swapnil Patil

**Principal Quality Engineering Platform Architect | QE Platform Lead | Fintech Systems**

I design and operate **release-grade Quality Engineering platforms** that provide
deterministic quality signals for go/no-go decisions at scale.

This GitHub is a **curated platform portfolio** showcasing architecture, governance,
and execution — not isolated test scripts.

## 🧭 Hiring Manager: Start Here

If you are reviewing this GitHub as part of an interview or hiring decision, this is
the fastest way to understand my work and impact.

### 1️⃣ QE Platform Contract (Foundation)
**`qe-platform-reference-architecture`**

This repository defines how I think about **quality at scale**:
- CI quality gates (PR smoke, nightly regression)
- release readiness and governance
- reporting and evidence standards
- onboarding expectations for teams

All other repositories **implement this contract**.

---

### 2️⃣ Platform Implementations (Execution)
Each platform applies the same contract to a different quality dimension:

- **UI Automation Platform** – `ui-fintech-automation-platform`  
  Release-grade UI automation with deterministic CI gates.

- **API Automation Platform** – `api-fintech-automation-platform`  
  Contract-driven API testing with reliable CI signals.

- **Performance Testing Platform** – `perf-fintech-testing-platform`  
  CI-enforced performance thresholds using Taurus and JMeter.

All platforms follow the same structure, documentation style, and gating philosophy.

### 3️⃣ What to Evaluate
Across repositories, focus on:
- architecture and separation of concerns
- CI workflows and gate definitions
- reporting and evidence artifacts
- documentation clarity and onboarding flow

Each repo include
