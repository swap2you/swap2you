# Swapnil Patil

**Principal Quality Engineering Platform Architect | QE Platform Lead | Fintech Systems**

I design and operate **release-grade Quality Engineering platforms** that provide
deterministic quality signals for go/no-go decisions at scale.

This GitHub is a **curated engineering portfolio** showcasing platform architecture,
governance, and execution — not isolated test scripts.

---

## 🔹 Core Focus Areas

- **Quality Engineering Platforms**  
  End-to-end platforms spanning UI, API, performance, and data validation

- **CI/CD Quality Gates**  
  PR smoke, nightly regression, threshold enforcement, and release readiness checks

- **Automation Architecture**  
  Java-based frameworks (Selenium, RestAssured, TestNG, Cucumber) built for scale

- **Performance Engineering**  
  Continuous performance pipelines using JMeter & Taurus with SLA validation

- **Fintech Systems**  
  Public-safe banking and financial system demos with contract-first validation

- **Documentation-as-Code**  
  Architecture docs, onboarding guides, governance models, and execution flows

## 🧭 Hiring Manager: Start Here

If you are reviewing this GitHub as part of an interview or hiring decision, here is the fastest way to understand my work:

### 1️⃣ Start with the QE Platform Contract
**`qe-platform-reference-architecture`**  
This defines how I think about **quality at scale**:
- CI quality gates (PR smoke, nightly regression)
- governance and release readiness
- reporting and evidence standards
- onboarding expectations for teams

This repo explains *how all other platforms are designed and operated*.

---

### 2️⃣ Review Platform Implementations
Each implementation applies the same contract to a different quality dimension:

- **UI Automation Platform**  
  `ui-fintech-automation-platform`  
  Release-grade UI automation with deterministic CI gates.

- **API Automation Platform**  
  `api-fintech-automation-platform`  
  Contract-driven API testing with reliable CI signals.

- **Performance Testing Platform**  
  `perf-fintech-testing-platform`  
  CI-enforced performance thresholds using Taurus and JMeter.

All platforms follow the same structure, documentation style, and gating philosophy.

---

### 3️⃣ What to Look For
Across all repositories, focus on:
- Architecture and separation of concerns
- CI workflows and gate definitions
- Reporting and evidence artifacts
- Documentation clarity and onboarding flow

Each repo includes a **3-minute interview demo guide** explaining what to open and how to discuss it.

---

### 4️⃣ Scope of This GitHub
This is a **platform portfolio**, not a collection of isolated test cases.
It demonstrates how I design, govern, and operationalize Quality Engineering systems
for organizations operating at scale.
