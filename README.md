# Swapnil Patil  
### Principal Quality Engineering Architect | QE Platform Lead | Fintech Systems

I design and implement **production-grade Quality Engineering platforms** focused on:
- deterministic CI quality gates
- scalable automation architectures
- fintech-grade reliability and governance
- executive-level visibility into quality signals

This GitHub is a **curated portfolio**, not a dump of experiments.

---

## 🔹 What I Specialize In

- **Quality Engineering Platforms** (UI, API, Performance)
- **CI/CD Quality Gates** (PR smoke, nightly regression, threshold enforcement)
- **Automation Architecture** (Java, Selenium, RestAssured, TestNG)
- **Performance Engineering** (JMeter, Taurus, SLA-driven pipelines)
- **Fintech Systems** (public-safe banking demos, contract-first testing)
- **Documentation-as-Code** (onboarding, governance, execution flows)

## 🔹 Flagship Repositories

### 🧭 QE Platform Contract
**`qe-platform-reference-architecture`**  
> Governance, quality gates, reporting standards, onboarding contract  
Defines how all QE repos must operate.

---

### 🖥 UI Automation Platform (Fintech)
**`ui-fintech-automation-platform`**  
> Selenium + Cucumber + TestNG + Allure  
Implements PR smoke + nightly regression gates against a fintech UI system.

---

### 🔌 API Automation Platform (Fintech)
**`api-fintech-automation-platform`**  
> RestAssured + TestNG + Allure  
Contract-driven API testing with deterministic gates and evidence artifacts.

---

### ⚡ Performance Testing Platform (Fintech)
**`perf-fintech-testing-platform`**  
> Taurus + JMeter + Threshold Gates  
CI-enforced performance smoke and regression pipelines with SLA validation.

## 🔹 How to Read This GitHub

Each platform repo includes:
- Architecture diagrams (ASCII, documentation-first)
- CI workflows (GitHub Actions)
- Clear test strategy (smoke vs regression)
- Evidence artifacts (reports, logs, metrics)
- 3-minute interview demo scripts

Start with the **QE Platform Contract**, then explore implementations.
