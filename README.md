# Swapnil Patil

**Principal Quality Engineering Platform Architect | QE Platform Lead | Fintech Systems**

I design and operate **release-grade Quality Engineering platforms** that provide
deterministic quality signals for go/no-go decisions at scale.

This GitHub is a **curated engineering portfolio** showcasing platform architecture,
governance, and execution — not isolated test scripts.

---

## 🔹 Core Focus Areas

- **Quality Engineering Platforms**  
  End-to-end platforms spanning UI, API, performance, and data validation

- **CI/CD Quality Gates**  
  PR smoke, nightly regression, threshold enforcement, and release readiness checks

- **Automation Architecture**  
  Java-based frameworks (Selenium, RestAssured, TestNG, Cucumber) built for scale

- **Performance Engineering**  
  Continuous performance pipelines using JMeter & Taurus with SLA validation

- **Fintech Systems**  
  Public-safe banking and financial system demos with contract-first validation

- **Documentation-as-Code**  
  Architecture docs, onboarding guides, governance models, and execution flows

---

## 🔹 Flagship Repositories

### 🧭 QE Platform Contract
**`qe-platform-reference-architecture`**

Defines the **governing contract** for all QE platforms:
- quality gates
- reporting standards
- onboarding expectations
- release governance

Start here to understand how all platforms operate.

### 🖥 UI Automation Platform (Fintech)
**`ui-fintech-automation-platform`**

- Selenium + Cucumber + TestNG + Allure  
- PR smoke gates and nightly regression pipelines  
- Evidence-driven reporting for release readiness

---

### 🔌 API Automation Platform (Fintech)
**`api-fintech-automation-platform`**

- RestAssured + TestNG + Allure  
- Contract-driven API validation  
- Deterministic CI quality gates with artifacts

---

### ⚡ Performance Testing Platform (Fintech)
**`perf-fintech-testing-platform`**

- Taurus + JMeter  
- CI-enforced performance smoke and regression gates  
- SLA thresholds integrated into pipelines

---

## 🔹 How to Navigate This GitHub

Each platform repository includes:

- Architecture & execution flow diagrams
- CI workflows (GitHub Actions)
- Clear smoke vs regression strategy
- Evidence artifacts (reports, logs, metrics)
- 3-minute interview demo scripts

**Recommended path:**  
Start with the **QE Platform Contract**, then explore each implementation.
